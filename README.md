# Progress bar with colors for Python2
Works bash/IPython.

## progress_bar2.py

progress_bar(count,total,bar_length,msg): displays a progress bar for count/total, the length of the bar is set by bar_length, displays msg after bar.
progress_bar_color(count,total,bar_length,msg): same as the one above, but with colors, needs tty_colors.py.

## tty_colors.py
Just a bunch of string constants for setting bash text color.
